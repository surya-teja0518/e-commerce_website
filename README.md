# E-commerce Customer Churn Prediction & Retention Strategy

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict customer churn in a simulated e-commerce business and develop data-driven strategies to reduce churn and improve customer lifetime value. It demonstrates an end-to-end analytical process, from data generation and exploration to machine learning model deployment and strategic recommendation.

**Core Competencies Demonstrated:**

* **Experience in analytics/data science:** Covered by the entire project lifecycle.
* **Hands-on experience on data manipulation tools like SQL, R, Python, Excel:** Demonstrated heavily through Python (pandas) for data manipulation, cleaning, and feature engineering.
* **Exposure to BI Platforms like Power BI, Tableau:** Conceptualized in the "Business Insights & Strategy" section for reporting.
* **Knowledge of basic statistical measurement frameworks:** Applied in EDA (measures of central tendency, dispersion, distribution, correlation) and experiment design (significance testing).
* **Basic knowledge of machine learning techniques like Regression, Classification:** Utilized Classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) for churn prediction.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into the following key phases:

1.  **Project Setup & Data Acquisition:** Setting up the environment and generating a synthetic e-commerce dataset.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Feature Engineering:** Understanding the data, deriving new features, and visualizing key relationships.
3.  **Predictive Modeling (Machine Learning):** Building, training, and evaluating classification models to predict churn.
4.  **Business Insights & Strategy Recommendation:** Interpreting model results, formulating actionable retention strategies, and outlining experimentation frameworks.

## Setup and Running the Project

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* Jupyter Notebook (recommended for interactive exploration) or a Python IDE.
* Required Python libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`.
